## Description

Tasks To Do is a React app written in typescript. This app is related to [a REST API personal project made in nestjs](https://github.com/mgcunado/newTasksToDo) to render in the frontend the tasks to be done in the future. It allows you to create a new task, edit it, view the task(s), order them, and all this using the reactive benefits of React.

The app is adapted for translations through i18n's communication with the nestjs API.
